### Study

1. Watch [Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbN57C5Zdl6j_qJA-pARJnKsmROzPnO9V), probaboly in the summer (by then I will have completed my ODE and Dynamical Systems courses). I finally bought the book for these lectures, which was recommeded by my undergraduate advisor long ago. 

2. Finish editing my notes for AMATH 515 Optimization. It looks chaotic at the moment.

3. Take an introductory CS course, such as Data Structures and Algorithms. I have to do lots of programming for research/study, so I really want to learn how to code efficiently.

4. Write a review of my MSc degree.


### Misc.

1. Complete [Photography Basics and Beyond Specilization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/photography-basics?). This course is comphrensive and well-organized. It costs nothing to audit, so I recommend to anyone interested in photography.

2. I need to start preparing for the JLPT test some time in summer. My goal is to take the December test.

3. COVID vaccine.
