### Study

1. I took AMATH 515 Fundamental Optimization in Winter 2021. This is an introduction to optimization theory, a broad field in mathematics. There are still many technical details in this course that I have not fully understood, so I want to write up my own notes for revision.   

2. Write a review of my Master's degree. This is the first time that I study mathematics rigorously and I got rather lost in the beginning, but soon I was on the right track. My coursework was mostly in three areas, probability and stochasitic processes, numerical analysis and differential equation, which are also core courses for UW's applied math PhD program. A final course I did was mathematical ecology. I have literally zero knowledge of biology/ecology, but this course turned out to be one of the most interested courses that I ever studied. I will dicsuss more about this in another post.  


### Others

1. Learn some photography skills through [Photography Basics and Beyond Specilization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/photography-basics?). I bought my Canon M50 ages ago but never used it...

2. I need to start preparing for the JLPT test some time in summer. My goal is to take the December test.

3. I need to get a COVID vaccine at some point.
