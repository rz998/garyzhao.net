As of mid-June, 2021, I have completed all the requirements for my Master of Science degree in Applied Mathematics. How time flies! When I first started in September 2020, I had serious doubts about my chance of success, in switching to an entirely different field. Reassuringly, applied math is really **my field**â€”I was happy about its level of theoretical rigor and its pragmatic role in tackling challengens in science and enigneering. In this article, I want to briefly review what I have learned in the past year.

## Numerical Analysis (AMATH 584/5/6)

>"Numerical analysis is the study of continuous algorithms", Nick Trefethen

If you ask an outsider what numerical analysis is, they will probably tell you that it's all about measuring errors. They are *not wrong*, but error is such a traumatic word that repels people away from this field. I was on this track as well. I kept thinking that numercial analysis is going to be dry, but magic continues to happen after I put myself into the trenches of numerical coding. When I say "trenches", I am comparing applied mathematicans to physicists. Physicists wrote down the equations, just like strategists in a war.
