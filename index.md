> Welcome to my blog!

I am a PhD student in the [Department of Applied Mathematics, University of Washington](https://amath.washington.edu/). Previously, I obtained my bachelor's degree from Imperial College London. I was fortunate to be advised by [Arash Mostofi](http://www.mostofigroup.org/) for my final thesis and [Serafim Kalliadasis](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/complex-multiscale-systems/) for my [UROP](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/urop) project. Here is my [resume](https://www.overleaf.com/project/5f85de481418a800016a7bf8).
